		<div class = "multicolumns">
		<p>A computer is a device that can perform computations and make
		 logical decisions phenomenally faster than human beings can.
		 Many of today's personal computers can perform billions of
		 calculations in one second&mdash;more than a human can perform
		 ina lifetime. Supercomputers are already performing thousands
		 of trillions Cquadrillions) of instructions per second! To put
		 that in perspective, a quadri]li1on-instructi1on-per-second
		 computer can perform in one second more than 100,000
		 calculations for every person on the planet! And&mdash;these
		 "upper limits" are growing quickly! </p>
		<p>Computers process data under the control of sets of
		 instructions called computer programs. These programs guide
		 the computer through orderly sets of actions specified by
		 people called computer programmers. The programs that run ona
		 computer are referred to as software. In this book, you'll
		 learn today's key programming methodology that's enhancing
		 programmer productivity, thereby reducing software-development
		 costs&mdash;object-oriented programming. </p>
		<p>A computer consists of various devices referred to as hardware
		 Ce.g., the keyboard, screen, mouse, hard disks, memory, DVDs
		 and processing units). Computing costs are dropping
		 dramatically, owing to rapid developments in hardware and
		 software technologies. Computers that might have filled large
		 rooms and cost millions of dollars decades ago are now
		 inscribed on silicon chips smaller than a fingernail, costing
		 perhaps a few dollars each. Ironically, silicon is one of the
		 most abundant materials&mdash;1t's an ingredient in common
		 sand. Silicon-chip technology has made computing so economical
		 that more than a billion general-purpose computers are in use
		 worldwide, and this is expected to double in the next few
		 years.</p>
		<p>Computer chips (microprocessors) control countless devices.
		 These embedded systems include anti-lock brakes in cars,
		 navigation systems, smart home appliances, home security
		 systems, cell phones and smartphones, robots, intelligent
		 traffic intersections, collision avoidance systems, video game
		 controllers and more. The vast majority of the microprocessors
		 produced each year are embedded in devices other than general-
		 purpose computers.</p>
