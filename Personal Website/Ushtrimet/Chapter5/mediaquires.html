			<p>A computer 1s a device that can perform computations and make
			 logical decisions phenomenally faster than human beings can.
			 Many of today's personal computers can perform billions of
			 calculations in one second&mdash;more than a human can perform
			 ina lifetime. Supercomputers are already performing thousands
			 of trillions Cquadrillions) of instructions per second! To put
			 that in perspective, a quadri]lion-instruction-per-second
			 computer can perform in one second more than 100,000
			 calculations for every person on the planet! And&mdash;these
			 "upper limits" are growing quickly! </p>
			<p>Computers process data under the control of sets of
			 Instructions called computer programs. These programs guide
			 the computer through orderly sets of actions specified by
			 people called computer programmers. The programs that run ona
			 computer are referred to as software. In this book, you'll
			 learn today's key programming methodology that's enhancing
			 programmer productivity, thereby reducing software-deve lopment
			 costs&mdash;object-oriented programming. </p>
			<p>A computer consists of various devices referred to as hardware
			 Ce.g., the keyboard, screen, mouse, hard disks, memory, DVDs
			 and processing units). Computing costs are dropping
			 dramatically, owing to rapid developments in hardware and
			 software technologies. Computers that might have filled large
			 rooms and cost millions of dollars decades ago are now
			 inscribed on silicon chips smaller than a fingernail, costing
			 perhaps a few dollars each. Ironically, silicon 1s one of the
			 most abundant materials&mdash;it's an ingredient in common
			 sand. Silicon-chip technology has made computing so economical
			 that more than a billion general-purpose computers are in use
			 worldwide, and this is expected to double in the next few
			 years.</p>
			<p>Computer chips (microprocessors) control countless devices.
			 These embedded systems include anti-lock brakes in cars,
			 navigation systems, smart home appliances, home security
			 systems, cell phones and smartphones, robots, intelligent
			 traffic intersections, collision avoidance systems, video game
			 controllers and more. The vast majority of the microprocessors
			 produced each year are embedded in devices other than general-
			 purpose computers.</p>
